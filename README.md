# R2D2_DetectorAndDecriptor
This is a TensorFlow Implementation of the following paper
[R2D2: Reliable and Repeatable Detector and Descriptor](http://papers.nips.cc/paper/9407-r2d2-reliable-and-repeatable-detector-and-descriptor.pdf)


I was trying to get use it on SAR images. You can train it for more epochs and change the training parameters to get better results. This is by no way as good as the the author implementation but it will give you an idea. Hope you find it educational. Use at your own risk. 

Here is the same notebook in kaggle:

This is the result I got from training on Sentinel-1 patches
